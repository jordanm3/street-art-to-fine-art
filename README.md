## Overview and Motivation
- For this project, my motivation was to develop a recommendation tool that could take a user-uploaded image of street art and return images of fine art, along with relevant information about the artwork, that are most visually similar. 

## Methodology 
Implementation of this project involved: 

1. Build a corpus of 35,000+ images and metadata using the public APIs from the following sources:   
      a. [The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met)](https://github.com/jordanm3/street-art-to-fine-art/blob/master/data_collection/met_data.ipynb)  
      b. [The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)](https://github.com/jordanm3/street-art-to-fine-art/blob/master/data_collection/moma_data.ipynb)

2. Create a single master dataframe containing the metadata from the images scraped from both The Met and MoMA. [Code for this step can be found here.](https://github.com/jordanm3/street-art-to-fine-art/blob/master/data_collection/metadata_final.ipynb)

3. Train a convolutional neural network autoencoder. Perform dimensionality reduction by taking the images of my corpus and passing them through 3 convolutional and pooling layers that learn the imageâ€™s features. Produce a narrow encoded layer that contains the lowest possible dimensions of the input data, allowing comparison between images to be computationally feasible. [Code found here.](https://github.com/jordanm3/street-art-to-fine-art/blob/master/models/autoencoder_model.ipynb)

4. Use the narrow encoded layer to encode the corpus of fine art images and a test street art image, resulting in a set of feature tensors. Use cosine similarity to compare the street art image to every fine art image in the corpus to find the most visually similar matches. [Code found here.](https://github.com/jordanm3/street-art-to-fine-art/blob/master/models/image_comparison.ipynb)
