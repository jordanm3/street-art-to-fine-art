## Overview and Motivation
- For this project, my motivation was to develop a recommendation tool that could take a user-uploaded image of street art and return images of fine art, along with relevant information about the artwork, that are most visually similar. 

## Methodology 
Implementation of this project involved: 

1. Build a corpus of 35,000+ images and metadata using the public APIs from the following sources:   
      a. [The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met)](https://github.com/jordanm3/street-art-to-fine-art/blob/master/data_collection/met_data.ipynb)  
      b. [The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)]
